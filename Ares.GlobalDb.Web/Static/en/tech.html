            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>
                How is RPGMusicTags.de made? Here, I give a few insights in the technology.
            </p> 
            <h4>Database</h4>
            <p>
                The data is stored in an <a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database. The reason for SQLite is the
                compatibility with <a href="http://aresrpg.sourceforge.net/">Ares</a>. Much code can be shared between
                Ares and RPGMusicTags, since an upload into the database is only in a few details different from a 
                download into the local database of Ares (and vice versa).<br />
                <br />
                The schema of the database is <a href="Tags_Schema.png">shown here</a>. For tags and categories, there
                are potentially many translations into different languages. If someone adds a translation, the tag is
                automatically assigned to all music titles in the new language, too.<br />
                <br />
                The assignments between tag and music title are stored per user, which is why users must give a name when
                they upload data. If a user removes a tag, this is stored in the RemovedTags table. In this way, a simple
                'voting' between the users regarding a tag is possible: when downloading tags, a tag is only returned for
                a music title if more users have it assigned than removed.
            </p>
            <h4>Music Identification</h4>
            <p>
                To identify a music title, <a href="http://acoustid.org">AcoustId</a> is used. Through their
                <a href="http://acoustid.org/chromaprint">Chromaprint</a> algorithm, a "fingerprint" of the music is
                calculated, and through the web service at AcoustId, the Id is retrieved. When uploading, artist, album and
                title are also stored to enable browsing. When downloading, the music can also be found with these attributes,
                but that is not very reliable.
            </p>
            <h4>Web Service</h4>
            <p>
                The web service and all web pages here are served through <a href="http://www.servicestack.net/">ServiceStack.net</a>. 
                This is a very simple way to create a web service with .NET. .NET must be used because the tags database shares much 
                code with <a href="http://aresrpg.sourceforge.net/">Ares</a>. All code for the web service is open source and is 
                contained in the sources of Ares.
