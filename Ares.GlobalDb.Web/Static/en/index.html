            <h4>What is RPGMusicTags.de?</h4>
            <p>
                RPGMusicTags.de is a database with music tags for (pen & paper) role-playing games. That means, it stores for different music
                titles tags which describe the music. Tags are put into categories and can describe e.g. a mood ("romantic", "mournful", ...), 
                a place ("dungeon", "orient", ...) or a situation ("fight", "travel", ...).
            </p>
            <h4>How can I use the data?</h4>
            <p>
                The easiest way is with an app which downlods the tags for music which you already have on your computer. Currently, such an app
                is the music- and sound player <a href="http://aresrpg.sourceforge.net">Ares</a>. In the player, you can then directly select tags
                which fit to the current situation during the game, and it will play the appropriate music.<br />
                <br />
                To get inspiration, to see what is already in the database or to find fitting music, you can also <a href="browse.html">browse</a>
                the database online.
            </p>
            <h4>From where does the data come?</h4>
            <p>
                From people who have assigned tags to music and who have then uploaded the tags into the database.
            </p>
            <h4>How can I add music or assign tags?</h4>
            <p>
                For this, you need an app (because the music must be identified, see <a href="tech.html">technology</a>). Currently, such an app
                is the music- and sound player <a href="http://aresrpg.sourceforge.net">Ares</a>. There, you assign tags to music (which you already
                have on your computer) and then share them into the database.
            </p>
            <h4>Is it possible to write another app which uses the data?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes, for this see the <a href="api.html">API</a> description.
